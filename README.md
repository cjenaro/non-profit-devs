# Non Profit Devs

A website where non profit developers and non profit organizations can meet.

## Collaboration

If you want to help improve this website, be my guest, you can pick any issue from github, for bugs I'm creating a new branch bug/<number of the issue> and for enhancements I'm creating a branch feat/<number of the issue> and once that is solved merged into dev and branch deleted.

If you want to help but don't know how to contribute to an open source project you can read [this](https://dev.to/janessatran/a-beginner-s-guide-to-contributing-to-open-source-4fen) or [this](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) or even filing a bug/enhancement already helps a ton! 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) bla bla bla...

Footnote: before commiting any changes run `yarn format`, let's keep this tidy and clean :smile:

For anyone going deep into this, that needs access to the backend, it lives [here](https://github.com/jenaro94/non-profit-devs-back) to get access to private variables we have to talk about it on our [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/nonprofitdevs/shared_invite/zt-fd7sjx0l-9vf9TRTA~4lfCiG78LRJuw)
